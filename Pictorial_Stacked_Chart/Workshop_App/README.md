# Notes on the files in Workshop_App folder

### Genji_Live.js
- CDN Link: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1C2cObu41erwg5G9oI8c2BNVEoP6o24X1
- Has both `Change Graphic` & `Graph Only` Buttons
- Includes the SVG Path variables at the bottom of the files (did not separate the files for simplicity)
- BUG FREE! It works!
- Next Ideal function:
  - Ability to change the Kintone field that the chart is based on easily
  - Currently need to change the code's field code manually...

### Survey_Data.csv
- CSV file used to create the demo app
- Fully functioning & the data is all fake

### Workshop.js
- CDN Link:
- Only has `Change Graphic` button (Will's request)
- Outside of this change, identical to [Genji_Live.js](./Genji_Live.js)

### yoda_ver.js
